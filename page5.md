  <ul>
  <li>The Spanish siesta (meaning “nap”) is a tradition that everyone knows about but few people put into practice.</li> 
  <li>Spain is a hot country, especially mid-afternoon, and the traditional reason for the siesta is for the workers in the fields to shelter from the heat. They would then 
  feel refreshed after their sleep and would work until quite late in the evening, longer than they would have been able to without the siesta.</li>
  <li>These factors explain why one of the many Spanish customs involves taking a nap after lunch. This means that most businesses and stores close between 2 and 4 p.m. Major 
   chains, however, are normally open all day without interruption.</li>
