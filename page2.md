<p>The batalla takes place during a week-long celebration filled with non-stop festivities and the ever-present anticipation of the monstrous tomato battle that puts a climactic end to the week's events.

During the week leading up to this epic food fight, the 9,000 inhabitants of Buñol watch as their town doubles in size. A whole week of parades, fireworks, food, and street parties make this town the center of attention in all of Spain. The night before La Tomatina, the town’s narrow medieval streets begin to fill with the smell of tomatoes.

In the early morning of the last Wednesday in August, shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza Mayor set about covering windows and doors in preparation for what’s to come. Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets and arrive in the crowd-filled square ready to unload their haul of tomatoes to be used as ammunition. Like many Spanish fiestas, La Tomatina begins with the sound of an exploding bottle rocket, which signals that it’s time to start throwing. Townspeople unload the tomatoes from the back of the trucks and begin pelting the crowd with some of the 120 tons of tomatoes.</p>

Traditionally, the middle stripe was defined by the more archaic term of gualda, and hence the popular name la Rojigualda (red-weld).</p>
