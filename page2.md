<h1>All About Spanish Culture!</h1>


<p>Spain is famous around the world for Flamenco music and dance, bullfights, fantastic beaches, and lots of sunshine. But what people sometimes forget is that Spain has been 
 one of the cultural centers of Europe for thousands of years.</p>
 
<p>Learning Spanish is not just grammar and vocabulary but also about getting to know its people, their culture and ways of life. Spanish traditions, customs, celebrations, 
 and other cultural activities are unique to Spanish society. So, if you want to learn all about Spanish culture, then you are in the right place!</p>

<h2>FIESTAS ESPAÑOLAS:</h2>

<h3 style="color:red">La Tomatina</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>La Tomatina is a food fight festival which happens on the last Wednesday of August each year in the town of Buñol near to Valencia in Spain.</li> 
  <li> The batalla (fight) takes place during a week-long celebration filled with non-stop festivities and the ever-present anticipation of the monstrous tomato battle that  
   puts a climactic end to the week's events.</li> 
  <li>During the week leading up to this fiesta, the town of Buñol doubles in size as people from all over the world come to participate. This is a whole week of parades, 
   fireworks, food, and street parties making this town the center of attention in all of Spain.</li>
  <li>In the early morning of the last Wednesday, all the shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza Mayor start to cover all the windows and doors in preparation for 
   what’s to come. </li>
  <li>Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets and arrive in the crowd-filled square ready to unload 120 tons of tomatoes. Finally, La Tomatina begins with the sound of 
   an exploding bottle rocket, which signals that it’s time to start throwing. Townspeople unload the tomatoes from the back of the trucks and begin pelting the crowd.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 style="color:blue">Fiesta de San Fermín</h3>
 <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A5_%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%A4%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94.jpg" width="400" height="222"></p>

  <ul>
  <li>The fiestas begin on July 6 with the launch of el chupinazo (firework rocket) in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (the same place where it all ends on 
   July 14th).</li>
  <li>During the days in between, bulls and humans alike run at top speeds through the city’s main streets on their way to the bullring.</li>
  <li> El encierro (A bull run) is a race that takes two to three minutes to run about 950 yards long and in each bull run around 2,000 people participate.</li>
  <li> Sanfermines is also a religious festival dedicated to Saint Fermin, so you can expect to see a variety of processions throughout the city on July 7.</li>
  </ul>

   <h3 style="color:DeepPink">Semana Santa</h3>
  <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Semana_Santa_La_Laguna_81.jpg" alt="La Tomatina" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
   <ul>
  <li>Spain’s Semana Santa traditions are vibrant celebrations with religious origins in which emotion-stirring processions make their way through cities and towns across the 
   country.</li>
  <li>Semana Santa festivities vary by region, each displaying their own special flavor. What they all have in common is a passionate observance of tradition that attracts 
   the devout and the curious each year, who gather on streets and squares to experience the intense ambience produced by the marching bands and costaleros, who carry 
   elaborate floats topped with statues of religious figures.</li>
  <li>The costaleros (float bearers) are led by the capataz (foreman), who’s responsible for ensuring that everyone marches perfectly together, creating a solemn and 
   hypnotizing rhythm. The floats are followed by nazarenos, dressed in long robes and tall, pointed hoods that completely cover their faces save for two small eyeholes, and 
   women dressed in raditional costume.</li>
  <li>The high point of the procession is when the floats exit and enter their respective churches.</li>
  <li>Emotions are stirred by the slow, rhythmic beating of the drums and processional marches, the swaying paces of the float bearers and the poignant wailing of the saetas, 
   flamenco-inspired verses sung during the processions.</li>

 <h2> COSTUMBRES ESPAÑOLAS:</h2>
 
 <div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue">La Siesta</h3>
<p><img src="https://openclipart.org/download/330067/man-sleeping.svg" alt="La Siesta" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
  <ul>
  <li>The Spanish siesta (meaning “nap”) is a tradition that everyone knows about but few people put into practice.</li> 
  <li>Spain is a hot country, especially mid-afternoon, and the traditional reason for the siesta is for the workers in the fields to shelter from the heat. They would then 
  feel refreshed after their sleep and would work until quite late in the evening, longer than they would have been able to without the siesta.</li>
  <li>These factors explain why one of the many Spanish customs involves taking a nap after lunch. This means that most businesses and stores close between 2 and 4 p.m. Major 
   chains, however, are normally open all day without interruption.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 style="color:SaddleBrown">Café</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.coffeegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/americano-1-500x333.jpg" alt="Café" width="400" height="222"></p>

  <ul>
  <li>Spain has a strong coffee culture, and it is not uncommon to drink four or five cups of coffee a day at all hours of the day. Café con leche, which is half strong black 
   coffee and half milk, is by far the most popular way to drink java in Spain. You might be asked how you want your milk – caliente (hot), templada (warm), or fría (cold).</li>
  <li>If a café con leche is too big for you, you can try a café cortado instead, which is a smaller version with only a touch of milk. Or if you’re craving something 
   stronger, try a café solo, which is a small glass of nothing but strong black coffee.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3 style="color:MediumPurple">Dos Besos En La Mejilla</h3>
  <p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1911/44907602981_c97d5fc571_b.jpg" alt="greeting kiss" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
  <ul>
  <li> In Spain, people greet each other and say goodbye with a kiss on each cheek.</li>
  <li>People usually touch their right cheeks together and make a kissing sound, then repeat the process on the left side.</li>
  <li>Spaniards don’t do this every morning when they come into work, but if you meet a friend for drinks or are introduced to someone new, the double cheek kiss is given to 
   say hello and goodbye.</li>
  <li>Women are always greeted this way, but two men shake hands with each other unless they are relatives.</li>
  </ul>
