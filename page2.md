<h2>FIESTAS ESPAÑOLAS:</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>La Tomatina is a food fight festival held on the last Wednesday of August each year in the town of Buñol near to Valencia in Spain. Thousands of people, from all over  
   the world come to fight in this 'World's Biggest Food Fight' where more than one hundred metric tons of over-ripe tomatoes are thrown in the streets.
 </li> The batalla (fight) takes place during a week-long celebration filled with non-stop festivities and the ever-present anticipation of the monstrous tomato battle that  
   puts a climactic end to the week's events.
  <li>During the week leading up to this epic food fight, the 9,000 inhabitants of Buñol watch as their town doubles in size. A whole week of parades, fireworks, food, and 
   street parties make this town the center of attention in all of Spain. The night before La Tomatina, the town’s narrow medieval streets begin to fill with the smell of 
   tomatoes.</li>
  <li>In the early morning of the last Wednesday in August, shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza Mayor start to cover the windows and doors in preparation for 
   what’s to come. Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets and arrive in the crowd-filled square ready to unload their haul of tomatoes to be used as ammunition. Like 
   many Spanish fiestas, La Tomatina begins with the sound of an exploding bottle rocket, which signals that it’s time to start throwing. Townspeople unload the tomatoes from 
   the back of the trucks and begin pelting the crowd with some of the 120 tons of tomatoes.</li>

<h3 style="color:blue">Fiesta de San Fermín</h3>
 <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A5_%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%A4%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94.jpg" width="400" height="222"></p>

  <ul>
  <li>The fiestas begin on July 6 with the launch of a firework rocket known as el chupinazo in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, the same place where it all comes to an end on 
   July 14th.</li>
  <li>During the days in between, bulls and humans alike run at top speeds through the city’s main streets on their way to the bullring. These are the world-famous bull runs 
   or encierros.</li>
  <li>A bull run is a race about 950 yards long that takes two to three minutes to run as long as nothing out of the ordinary happens. Around 2,000 people participate in each 
   bull run, which makes running the entire route practically impossible.</li>
  <li>The San Fermín festival was made famous by Ernest Hemingway when he included it in a scene from his novel The Sun Also Rises. Ever since, thousands of tourists set 
   aside these days of the year to visit Pamplona and, while they’re at it, other parts of Spain.</li>
  <li>The sheer number of people coming into the city means that nobody feels like they don’t belong. There’s always someone next to you from some far-flung part of the  
   world. And  since everyone wears white and dons a red handkerchief around their neck, no one feels out of place.</li>
  <li> Sanfermines is also a religious festival dedicated to Saint Fermin, so you can expect to see a variety of processions throughout the city on July 7.</li>

   <h3 style="color:DeepPink">Semana Santa</h3>
  <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Semana_Santa_La_Laguna_81.jpg" alt="La Tomatina" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
   <ul>
  <li>Spain’s Semana Santa traditions are vibrant celebrations with religious origins in which emotion-stirring processions make their way through cities and towns across the 
   country, backdropped by spring weather and unique landscapes.</li>
  <li>Semana Santa festivities vary by region, each displaying their own special flavor; those from the Andalusia region are particularly famous for their powerfully charged 
   mood. What they all have in common is a passionate observance of tradition that attracts the devout and the curious each year, who gather on streets and squares to 
   experience the intense ambience produced by the marching bands and costaleros, who carry elaborate floats topped with statues of religious figures.</li>
  <li>The so-called costaleros are led by the capataz, who’s responsible for ensuring that everyone marches perfectly together, creating a solemn and hypnotizing rhythm. The 
   floats are followed by nazarenos, dressed in long robes and tall, pointed hoods that completely cover their faces save for two small eyeholes, and women dressed in 
   traditional costume.</li>
  <li>The high point of the procession is when the floats exit and enter their respective churches. This is the moment when art and religion seem to merge into one. The 
   sculptures of the religious images are created by superb craftsmen; the best floats date back to the 16th and 17th centuries and can still be seen today.</li>
  <li>Emotions are stirred by the slow, rhythmic beating of the drums and processional marches, the swaying paces of the float bearers and the poignant wailing of the saetas, 
   flamenco-inspired verses sung during the processions.</li>
  <li>Even if you are not religious, it is difficult not to be moved by an atmosphere so vital and poignant. For some it is a fun-filled fiesta time, for others a week of 
   ritual and reflection. Without a doubt, the traditions of Semana Santa form an integral part of Spanish culture and identity.</li>

 <h2> COSTUMBRES ESPAÑOLAS:</h2>
 
 <div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue">La Siesta</h3>
<p><img src="https://openclipart.org/download/330067/man-sleeping.svg" alt="La Siesta" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
  <ul>
  <li>The Spanish siesta (meaning “nap”) is a tradition that everyone knows about but few people put into practice.</li> 
   <li>In Spain, lunch is the biggest meal of the day and since Spaniards don’t take breakfast very seriously and dinner tends to be something light at the very end of the 
    day, people tend to eat a lot at lunchtime, making them feel more tired.</li> 
  <li>This combined with the fact that Spain usually experiences high temperatures at midday, especially in the summer, makes doing any type of work or activity, whether 
   mental or physical, an uphill battle.</li>
  <li>These factors explain why one of the many Spanish customs involves taking a nap after lunch. This means that most businesses and stores close between 2 and 4 p.m.</li>
  <li> So, employees can go home, eat, and rest during the hottest part of the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
  <li>When you’re in Spain, one phrase you’ll often hear in English (pronounced with Spanish accent) is Spain is different. When you live here, you’ll discover that this 
   phrase rings true in many ways, but perhaps some of the quintessentially Spanish things many tourists first experience are the Spanish customs surrounding food.</li>
  <li>From the moment you step off the plane and walk around the airport, you’ll find a variety of Spanish-style bars and restaurants. In fact, a study published in 2010 by 
   La Caixa found that, in Spain, there’s an average of 1 bar for every 129 Spaniards. This brings us to the simple fact that eating and drinking are a very important part of 
   Spanish culture.</li>
  <li>One thing foreigners should keep in mind is that in Spain most bars are restaurants, and vice versa. These establishments are social meeting places where people can 
   have fun — watching a soccer game, having a coffee, eating, drinking, partying, and really just about anything is a good excuse to go to a bar, which explains why there 
   are so many of them. A typical bar will always have a nice variety of pinchos or tapas that vary from region to region and are usually included in the price of the drink 
   or offered at a discount.</li>

  <ul>
  <li> In Spain, people greet each other and say goodbye with a kiss on each cheek.</li>
  <li>People usually touch their right cheeks together and make a kissing sound, then repeat the process on the left side.</li>
  <li>Spaniards don’t do this every morning when they come into work, but if you meet a friend for drinks or are introduced to someone new, the double cheek kiss is given to 
   say hello and goodbye.</li>
  <li>Women are always greeted this way, but two men shake hands with each other unless they are relatives.</li>
