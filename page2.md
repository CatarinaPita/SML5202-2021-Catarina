  <li>La Tomatina is a food fight festival held on the last Wednesday of August each year in the town of Buñol near to Valencia in Spain. Thousands of people, from all over  
   the world come to fight in this 'World's Biggest Food Fight' where more than one hundred metric tons of over-ripe tomatoes are thrown in the streets.
 </li> The batalla (fight) takes place during a week-long celebration filled with non-stop festivities and the ever-present anticipation of the monstrous tomato battle that  
   puts a climactic end to the week's events.
  <li>During the week leading up to this epic food fight, the 9,000 inhabitants of Buñol watch as their town doubles in size. A whole week of parades, fireworks, food, and 
   street parties make this town the center of attention in all of Spain. The night before La Tomatina, the town’s narrow medieval streets begin to fill with the smell of 
   tomatoes.</li>
  <li>In the early morning of the last Wednesday in August, shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza Mayor start to cover the windows and doors in preparation for 
   what’s to come. Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets and arrive in the crowd-filled square ready to unload their haul of tomatoes to be used as ammunition. Like 
   many Spanish fiestas, La Tomatina begins with the sound of an exploding bottle rocket, which signals that it’s time to start throwing. Townspeople unload the tomatoes from 
   the back of the trucks and begin pelting the crowd with some of the 120 tons of tomatoes.</li>

<h3 style="color:blue">Fiesta de San Fermín</h3>
 <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A5_%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%A4%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94.jpg" width="400" height="222"></p>

  <ul>
  <li>The fiestas begin on July 6 with the launch of a firework rocket known as el chupinazo in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, the same place where it all comes to an end on 
   July 14th.</li>
  <li>During the days in between, bulls and humans alike run at top speeds through the city’s main streets on their way to the bullring. These are the world-famous bull runs or   
 encierros.</li>
  <li>A bull run is a race about 950 yards long that takes two to three minutes to run as long as nothing out of the ordinary happens. Around 2,000 people participate in each 
   bull run, which makes running the entire route practically impossible.</li>
  <li>The San Fermín festival was made famous by Ernest Hemingway when he included it in a scene from his novel The Sun Also Rises. Ever since, thousands of tourists set 
   aside these days of the year to visit Pamplona and, while they’re at it, other parts of Spain.</li>
  <li>The sheer number of people coming into the city means that nobody feels like they don’t belong. There’s always someone next to you from some far-flung part of the  
   world. And  since everyone wears white and dons a red handkerchief around their neck, no one feels out of place.</li>
  <li> Sanfermines is also a religious festival dedicated to Saint Fermin, so you can expect to see a variety of processions throughout the city on July 7.</li>

   <h3 style="color:DeepPink">Semana Santa</h3>
  <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Semana_Santa_La_Laguna_81.jpg" alt="La Tomatina" width="400" height="222"></p>
 
   <ul>
  <li>Spain’s Semana Santa traditions are vibrant celebrations with religious origins in which emotion-stirring processions make their way through cities and towns across the 
   country, backdropped by spring weather and unique landscapes.</li>
  <li>Semana Santa festivities vary by region, each displaying their own special flavor; those from the Andalusia region are particularly famous for their powerfully charged 
   mood. What they all have in common is a passionate observance of tradition that attracts the devout and the curious each year, who gather on streets and squares to 
   experience the intense ambience produced by the marching bands and costaleros, who carry elaborate floats topped with statues of religious figures.</li>
  <li>The so-called costaleros are led by the capataz, who’s responsible for ensuring that everyone marches perfectly together, creating a solemn and hypnotizing rhythm. The 
   floats are followed by nazarenos, dressed in long robes and tall, pointed hoods that completely cover their faces save for two small eyeholes, and women dressed in 
   traditional costume.</li>
  <li>The high point of the procession is when the floats exit and enter their respective churches. This is the moment when art and religion seem to merge into one. The 
   sculptures of the religious images are created by superb craftsmen; the best floats date back to the 16th and 17th centuries and can still be seen today.</li>
  <li>Emotions are stirred by the slow, rhythmic beating of the drums and processional marches, the swaying paces of the float bearers and the poignant wailing of the saetas, 
   flamenco-inspired verses sung during the processions.</li>
  <li>Even if you are not religious, it is difficult not to be moved by an atmosphere so vital and poignant. For some it is a fun-filled fiesta time, for others a week of 
   ritual and reflection. Without a doubt, the traditions of Semana Santa form an integral part of Spanish culture and identity.</li>
